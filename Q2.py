"""
Task-2: Managing a ToDo List
1. Create a Python class named Task.
2. Define the following methods within the Task class:
	set_task_detail(self, task_name, priority)
	mark_as_complete(self)
	display_task_info(self)
3. Create an object of the Task class.
4. Use the set_task_details method to set the task_name, and taskâ€™s priority.
5. Use the mark_as_complete method to mark the task as completed.
6. Finally, use the display_task_info method to print the toDo List.
